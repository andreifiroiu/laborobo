# Laborobo - Product Design Export

This package contains the complete product design for Laborobo, an AI-powered work orchestration platform for small service teams.

## What's Inside

This export includes everything needed to implement Laborobo:

- **Product Overview** - Vision, problems/solutions, key features
- **Design System** - Colors (indigo/emerald/slate), typography (Inter/IBM Plex Mono), design tokens
- **Data Model** - All entities, relationships, and TypeScript types
- **Application Shell** - Navigation, user menu, organization switching
- **Section Designs** - 8 fully-designed sections with components and props
- **Implementation Instructions** - Step-by-step guides for each milestone
- **Ready-to-Use Prompts** - Copy/paste prompts for coding agents
- **Test Specifications** - TDD instructions for each section

## Quick Start

### For AI Coding Agents

1. **One-Shot Implementation** (build everything at once):
   - Copy `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` into your coding agent
   - Provide the implementation instructions from `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md`
   - Let the agent build the complete application

2. **Incremental Implementation** (milestone by milestone):
   - Use `prompts/section-prompt.md` as a template
   - Start with `instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`
   - Progress through each milestone (02-shell, 03-today, etc.)

### For Human Developers

1. **Review the Product**:
   - Read `product-overview.md` to understand the vision
   - Explore `data-model/README.md` for entities and relationships
   - Review `design-system/` for colors, fonts, and tokens

2. **Set Up Your Project**:
   - Choose your tech stack (see Tech Stack Decisions below)
   - Install Tailwind CSS v4
   - Import Google Fonts (Inter + IBM Plex Mono)
   - Set up design tokens from `design-system/tokens.css`

3. **Implement Incrementally**:
   - Follow `instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md` first
   - Build the shell (`instructions/incremental/02-shell.md`)
   - Implement sections one by one (Today, Work, Inbox, etc.)
   - Use the test specifications in each section's `tests.md`

## Design System

### Colors

**Primary (Indigo)**: Actions, links, active states
- Main: `indigo-600`
- Hover: `indigo-700`
- Active: `indigo-800`

**Secondary (Emerald)**: Success states, positive actions
- Main: `emerald-600`
- Hover: `emerald-700`

**Neutral (Slate)**: Text, backgrounds, borders
- Page BG: `slate-50` / `slate-900` (dark)
- Card BG: `white` / `slate-800` (dark)
- Text: `slate-600` / `slate-300` (dark)
- Borders: `slate-200` / `slate-700` (dark)

### Typography

**Heading & Body**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700)
**Monospace**: IBM Plex Mono (400, 500)

### Key Principles

- **Mobile Responsive**: Use Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`)
- **Dark Mode**: Support light and dark themes using `dark:` variants
- **Props-Based Components**: All data via props, no direct imports
- **No Navigation in Sections**: Shell handles all navigation

## Implementation Order

### Milestone 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Set up project with Tailwind v4
- Import design tokens and fonts
- Implement data model types
- Set up routing
- Build application shell

### Milestone 2-9: Sections (Weeks 2-9)
- Implement one section per week
- Start with Today (simplest)
- Build Work section (most complex) in middle
- End with Settings and User Menu

## Testing Strategy

Each section includes `tests.md` with:

- **UI Component Tests**: Verify rendering with props
- **User Flow Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Empty State Tests**: Handle missing data gracefully
- **Error State Tests**: Test failure scenarios
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and limits
- **Integration Tests**: Test section with shell

Use your preferred testing framework:
- **Vitest** + React Testing Library (recommended)
- **Jest** + React Testing Library
- **Playwright** for E2E tests

## Multi-Organization Architecture

Laborobo supports multiple organizations per user:

- Each organization has **completely separate**:
  - Subscription plan and billing
  - Workspace settings
  - Team members and permissions
  - Projects, work orders, tasks
  - AI agent budgets and configurations
  - Integration connections

- User's **global settings** (persist across orgs):
  - Profile information
  - Appearance preferences
  - Notification preferences

- **Organization Switching**:
  - Keeps user on same page type (Today→Today, Work→Work)
  - Changes entire data context
  - No page reload required

## Key Features to Implement

### Human-in-the-Loop Approvals
- AI agents generate drafts but cannot deliver
- All agent outputs require human approval
- Approve, reject with feedback, or edit before approving

### Work Graph Structure
Parties → Projects → Work Orders → Tasks → Deliverables

### SOP-Driven Workflows
- Attach SOPs to work orders for guidance
- AI agents follow SOP steps
- Checklists with evidence requirements

### AI Agent Permissions
- Configurable permission boundaries
- Budget caps per agent
- Run limits (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Approval requirements for sensitive actions

### Time Tracking Modes
- **Manual**: User logs hours
- **Timer**: Start/stop timer per task
- **AI Estimation**: Agent suggests hours based on scope

## Getting Help

- Review the section READMEs for detailed specs
- Check `tests.md` files for expected behaviors
- Use sample data in `sample-data.json` for testing
- Refer to design system docs for styling guidance
