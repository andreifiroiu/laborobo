# Laborobo — Product Overview

## Summary

Laborobo is an AI-powered work orchestration platform for small service teams (2-10 people). It turns messy requests into structured deliverables, with AI agents handling drafts, analysis, and busywork while humans approve outcomes. Built for teams with limited staff and skill gaps who need to maintain quality without formal processes or specialist hires. A user should be able to define multiple organizations/teams and switch between them. Each organization will need a separate subscription and will have completely different settings and data.

## Planned Sections

1. **Today** — "What needs your brain right now" - approvals waiting, blockers, due today, what to do next
2. **Work** — Projects → Work Orders → Tasks → Deliverables. Includes inline: artifacts, comms threads, time entries
3. **Inbox** — Agent drafts awaiting review, approval requests, flagged items (risks, missing info)
4. **Playbooks** — SOPs & Checklists, templates (work order templates, doc templates), acceptance criteria library
5. **Directory** — Parties (clients, vendors, departments, stakeholders), team members & their skills
6. **Reports** — Project status rollups, workload & capacity, time & budget tracking
7. **Settings** — AI Agents (configuration, capacity, budgets), integrations, workspace settings
8. **UserMenu** — Organization switching, create new organization, organization settings, user profile, user logout
