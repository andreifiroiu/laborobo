## Define Section Variables

- **SECTION_NAME** = "Playbooks"
- **SECTION_ID** = "playbooks"
- **NN** = "06"

---

I need you to implement the **[SECTION NAME]** section of Laborobo, an AI-powered work orchestration platform.


## Context

I'm building Laborobo incrementally, one section at a time. The foundation (project setup, design system, routing, and application shell) is already complete.

**What Laborobo Does**: Turns messy work requests into structured deliverables with AI agents handling drafts while humans approve outcomes. Built for small service teams (2-10 people).

**Core Workflow**: Parties → Projects → Work Orders → Tasks → Deliverables

## This Section: [SECTION NAME]

**Purpose**: The knowledge base that makes AI agents useful. Contains reusable SOPs (step-by-step procedures), Checklists (task lists), Templates (pre-built structures), and Acceptance Criteria (definitions of "done"). Enables consistency across projects and empowers AI agents to follow documented procedures. "This is how we do things."

## User Flows
- **Browse playbooks by type** - User switches between tabs (SOPs, Checklists, Templates, Acceptance Criteria) to view organized lists of each type
- **Search and filter** - User searches across all playbook names, descriptions, content, and tags; filters by tags/categories; sorts by usage/popularity or recently updated
- **View playbook details** - User clicks a playbook to open full page view showing complete content, structure-specific fields, usage statistics, and related work orders
- **Create new playbook** - User selects playbook type, provides AI prompt to generate initial structure, then refines using structured form fields specific to the type (steps for SOPs, items for checklists, etc.)
- **Edit existing playbook** - User opens playbook in edit mode and modifies using structured form fields, with changes tracked in version history
- **Apply to work orders** - User manually searches and attaches playbooks when creating/editing work orders, OR AI agent automatically suggests and attaches relevant playbooks based on work type and context
- **Track usage** - User views which playbooks are most-used, which work orders use each playbook, and effectiveness metrics

## UI Requirements
- Tab navigation for 4 types (SOPs, Checklists, Templates, Acceptance Criteria) with count badges
- List view with cards showing: name, type badge, description preview, usage count, tags, last updated date
- Full page detail view with type-specific structure:
    - **SOPs**: Trigger conditions, ordered steps with evidence requirements, roles involved, estimated time, definition of done, tags
    - **Checklists**: Checkbox items with optional assignees and evidence per item
    - **Templates**: Structure preview (project milestones, work order pre-fill, document template)
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Reusable criteria blocks with validation rules
- Create/edit interface with AI prompt input and structured form fields based on playbook type
- Full-text search bar across all content
- Tag filter pills for categorization
- Sort options: by usage/popularity, recently updated
- Usage statistics panel showing times applied, related work orders, success metrics
- Version history tracking
- Empty states per tab with "Create your first [type]" prompts
- AI suggestion indicators when playbooks are auto-attached to work items

**Files Provided**:
- `sections/[section-id]/README.md` - Complete specification
- `sections/[section-id]/components/` - React components (reference implementation)
- `sections/[section-id]/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `sections/[section-id]/sample-data.json` - Sample data for development
- `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` - Test specifications
- `instructions/incremental/[NN]-[section-id].md` - Step-by-step implementation guide

## Before You Start - Questions for Me

1. **Data Source**: Should I use mock data from `sample-data.json` or connect to an API?
2. **State Management**: Should I use React Query for server state? Local state only?
3. **Forms**: Should I use React Hook Form + Zod for validation?
4. **Modals/Drawers**: Should I use a library (Radix UI, Headless UI) or build custom?

## Implementation Requirements

### Design System (Already Set Up)

- **Colors**: Indigo (primary), Emerald (secondary), Slate (neutral)
- **Typography**: Inter (headings/body), IBM Plex Mono (code)
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Use built-in utilities, avoid custom CSS
- **Dark Mode**: Support light and dark using `dark:` variants
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with sm: (768px) and lg: (1024px) breakpoints

### Component Patterns

1. **Props-Based**: All data via props, no direct data imports
2. **No Navigation**: Don't include nav chrome, shell handles routing
3. **Empty States**: Show helpful messages when no data exists
4. **Loading States**: Show skeletons or spinners during data fetch
5. **Error States**: Handle failures gracefully with retry options
6. **TypeScript**: Use types from `sections/[section-id]/types.ts`

### Integration with Shell

The section will be rendered inside `<AppShell>` like this:

```tsx
<AppShell navigationItems={...} user={...}>
  <[SectionName]Page />
</AppShell>
```

Your section should render in the main content area (no shell or nav needed).

## What to Implement

Please review the detailed specification and implement:

1. **Main Page Component**: The top-level component for this section
2. **Sub-Components**: All components listed in `components/` directory
3. **State Management**: Handle data fetching, mutations, and local state
4. **User Interactions**: All buttons, forms, and actions from the spec
5. **Responsive Layout**: Adapt UI for mobile, tablet, and desktop
6. **Empty States**: What users see when no data exists
7. **Loading States**: Feedback during async operations
8. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with retry/fallback

## Testing Requirements

Implement tests as specified in `sections/[section-id]/tests.md`:

- [ ] Component rendering with various props
- [ ] Complete user flows (end-to-end workflows)
- [ ] Empty state handling (no data scenarios)
- [ ] Error states (API failures, validation errors)
- [ ] Edge cases (boundary values, unusual inputs)
- [ ] Responsive behavior (mobile/tablet/desktop)

## Example: Implementing the "Today" Section

If implementing the Today section:

```typescript
// app/today/page.tsx
import { TodayView } from '@/sections/today/components'
import { useTodayData } from '@/lib/hooks'

export default function TodayPage() {
  const {
    dailySummary,
    approvals,
    tasks,
    blockers,
    upcomingDeadlines,
    activities,
    metrics,
    isLoading
  } = useTodayData()

  if (isLoading) {
    return <TodayLoadingSkeleton />
  }

  return (
    <TodayView
      dailySummary={dailySummary}
      approvals={approvals}
      tasks={tasks}
      blockers={blockers}
      upcomingDeadlines={upcomingDeadlines}
      activities={activities}
      metrics={metrics}
      onViewApproval={(id) => console.log('View approval:', id)}
      onApprove={(id) => console.log('Approve:', id)}
      onReject={(id) => console.log('Reject:', id)}
      // ... other callbacks
    />
  )
}
```

## What Success Looks Like

When complete, I should be able to:

1. Navigate to this section from the sidebar
2. See all UI elements from the specification
3. Interact with all buttons, forms, and actions
4. View the section on mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. See appropriate messages when data is empty
6. See loading indicators during data operations
7. See error messages when operations fail
8. Complete all user flows described in the spec

## Steps to Implement

1. **Review the Spec**: Read `sections/[section-id]/README.md` thoroughly
2. **Study Sample Data**: Understand data structure in `sample-data.json`
3. **Check Types**: Review TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts`
4. **Reference Components**: Look at existing components in `components/`
5. **Follow Instructions**: Use `instructions/incremental/[NN]-[section-id].md` as your guide
6. **Write Tests**: Implement tests from `tests.md`
7. **Manual Test**: Verify all user flows work end-to-end

## Additional Notes

- Use the exact button labels and UI text from the specification
- Follow the test cases for expected behaviors and edge cases
- Implement graceful empty states (helpful messages, call-to-action buttons)
- Support both success and failure paths for all actions
- Ensure dark mode works for all UI elements
- Make interactive elements keyboard-accessible

## Files Available

- Reference components (components/)
- TypeScript types (types.ts)
- Sample data for testing (sample-data.json)
- Test specifications (tests.md)
