# Task Breakdown: My Work View Improvements

## Overview
Total Tasks: 30 (across 5 task groups)

This feature enhances the "My Work" subsection of the Work page to provide RACI-aware filtering, subtab navigation (Tasks, Work Orders, Projects, All), summary metrics, and visual hierarchy based on RACI roles.

## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:

1. **Backend Layer (Task Group 1)** - RACI query scopes on models
2. **API Layer (Task Group 2)** - Controller updates and data preparation
3. **Frontend Components (Task Group 3)** - New UI components
4. **Integration (Task Group 4)** - Combine components into My Work view
5. **Test Review (Task Group 5)** - Fill critical test gaps

## Files to Create

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `resources/js/components/work/raci-badge.tsx` | RACI role badge component |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-subtabs.tsx` | Subtab navigation component |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-filters.tsx` | Filter and sort controls |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-metrics.tsx` | Summary metrics display |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-tree-view.tsx` | Hierarchical tree view for "All" subtab |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-tasks-list.tsx` | Tasks subtab list view |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-orders-list.tsx` | Work Orders subtab list view |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-projects-list.tsx` | Projects subtab list view |

## Files to Modify

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app/Models/Project.php` | Add RACI query scope methods |
| `app/Models/WorkOrder.php` | Add RACI query scope methods |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Work/WorkController.php` | Add My Work data methods and metrics |
| `resources/js/components/work/my-work-view.tsx` | Integrate new components |
| `resources/js/types/work.ts` | Add RACI-related TypeScript types |

## Technical Notes

- **RACI Fields Exist**: Both Project and WorkOrder models already have `accountable_id`, `responsible_id`, `consulted_ids`, and `informed_ids` fields
- **Query Pattern for Arrays**: Use `whereJsonContains` for `consulted_ids` and `informed_ids` which are JSON arrays
- **Preference Pattern**: Follow existing `UserPreference::get/set` pattern used in WorkController
- **Badge Pattern**: Use class-variance-authority approach from existing StatusBadge component
- **Tree View Pattern**: Leverage existing ProjectTreeItem structure for hierarchical display
