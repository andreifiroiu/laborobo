# Raw Idea: My Work View Improvements

## Feature Description

The user wants to improve the "My Work" subsection of the Work page. Key requirements:
- Better overview of all projects, work orders, and tasks assigned to the user
- Include items where the user has any RACI role (not just direct assignment)
- Subtabs for each item type (projects, work orders, tasks)
- Open to alternative view proposals

## Context

This feature focuses on enhancing the user's ability to view and manage their assigned work items across the work graph structure (Projects, Work Orders, and Tasks). The current implementation may not provide adequate visibility into all items where the user has responsibility through RACI roles.

## Initial Requirements

1. Better overview of all projects, work orders, and tasks assigned to the user
2. Include items where the user has any RACI role (not just direct assignment)
3. Subtabs for each item type (projects, work orders, tasks)
4. Open to alternative view proposals
