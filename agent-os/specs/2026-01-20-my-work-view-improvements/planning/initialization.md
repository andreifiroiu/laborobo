# My Work View Improvements - Initial Idea

## Raw Description
- Improve the "My Work" subsection of the Work page
- Better overview of all projects, work orders, and tasks assigned to the user
- Include items where the user has any RACI role (not just direct assignment)
- Subtabs for each item type (projects, work orders, tasks)
- Open to alternative view proposals

## Context from Orchestrator
Research the existing codebase to understand:
1. Current My Work implementation
2. Existing RACI role structures (if any)
3. Current Work page architecture
4. Available data models (Project, WorkOrder, Task)

Then generate clarifying questions to understand:
- How RACI roles should be implemented/displayed
- Priority and filtering preferences
- What information should be shown for each item type
- Any dashboard/summary metrics desired
- Visual layout preferences
