## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence based on dependencies:

1. **Task Group 1: S3 Storage Integration** - Foundation for all file storage
2. **Task Group 2: Data Models and Migrations** - Database layer for new entities
3. **Task Group 3: Controllers and Policies** - API endpoints and authorization
4. **Task Group 4: File Preview and Folder Navigation** - Core UI components
5. **Task Group 5: Commenting and Annotation System** - Advanced UI features
6. **Task Group 6: External Sharing UI** - Public access components
7. **Task Group 7: Test Review and Gap Analysis** - Final validation

## Technical Notes

### Existing Code to Leverage

| Pattern | Location | Usage |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Document model | `app/Models/Document.php` | Extend with folder_id, thread(), annotations() |
| CommunicationThread | `app/Models/CommunicationThread.php` | Reuse for comments |
| FileUploadService | `app/Services/FileUploadService.php` | Extend for S3 support |
| DeliverableVersionController | `app/Http/Controllers/Work/DeliverableVersionController.php` | Pattern for authorization |
| FilePreview | `resources/js/components/work/file-preview.tsx` | Extend for Office formats |
| FileUploader | `resources/js/components/work/file-uploader.tsx` | Add folder selection |

### Key Technical Decisions

- **Coordinates as percentages**: Enables responsive positioning across screen sizes
- **Signed URLs**: Secure time-limited access to S3 files (60-minute default)
- **Token generation**: 64-character cryptographically secure tokens via `Str::random(64)`
- **Password hashing**: Use Laravel's `Hash::make()` and `Hash::check()` for share link passwords
- **Folder nesting limit**: 3 levels maximum for UI simplicity
- **Office preview**: Microsoft Office Online Viewer embed (view.officeapps.live.com)

### Routes to Add

```php
// Folder routes (authenticated)
Route::resource('folders', FolderController::class);

// Document comments (authenticated)
Route::resource('documents.comments', DocumentCommentController::class);

// Document annotations (authenticated)
Route::resource('documents.annotations', DocumentAnnotationController::class);

// Share links (authenticated)
Route::resource('documents.share-links', DocumentShareLinkController::class);

// Public shared document access (no auth)
Route::get('shared/{token}', [SharedDocumentController::class, 'show'])->name('shared.document');
Route::post('shared/{token}/verify', [SharedDocumentController::class, 'verify'])->name('shared.verify');
```
