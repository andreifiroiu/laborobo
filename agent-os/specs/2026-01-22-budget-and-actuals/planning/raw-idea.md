# Budget and Actuals - Raw Idea

Add financial cost tracking to the existing hours-based project management system. This includes:
- Hourly rates on users/teams for cost calculation
- Cost fields on WorkOrders and Projects (estimated_cost, actual_cost, budget_amount)
- Cost calculation from time entries (hours × hourly rate)
- Budget vs Actuals views showing cost variance (not just hours)
- Margin calculations (billing rate vs labor cost)
- Profitability reports and dashboards

The hour tracking foundation already exists - this feature adds the cost/financial dimension on top of it.
