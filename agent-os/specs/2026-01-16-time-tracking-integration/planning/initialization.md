# Time Tracking Integration

## Initial Idea

Time Tracking Integration - Time entry UI for logging hours against tasks/work orders, timer functionality, time log history, and basic time reporting by user and project.

## Source

From product roadmap item #13:
"Time Tracking Integration - Time entry UI for logging hours against tasks/work orders, timer functionality, time log history, and basic time reporting by user and project."

## Context

This feature builds on the existing TimeEntry model which supports:
- Manual time entry
- Timer mode with start/stop timestamps
- AI estimation mode
- Linking time to tasks (which cascade up to work orders and projects)

The goal is to create the UI layer that allows users to interact with time tracking throughout the application.
