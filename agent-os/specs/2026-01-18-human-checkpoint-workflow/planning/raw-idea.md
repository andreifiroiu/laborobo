# Raw Idea: Human Checkpoint Workflow

## Feature Description

Implement a Draft > Review > Approve > Deliver state machine for work items (tasks, work orders), with role-based transition permissions and approval flow enforcement. This extends the existing deliverable status workflow to cover all work items in the system.

## Key Aspects

- State machine for work items with defined transitions
- Role-based permissions for who can transition between states
- Approval workflow enforcement
- Integration with existing task and work order models

## Context

This feature extends the existing deliverable status workflow to provide consistent state management across all work items in the system, ensuring proper review and approval processes before work is considered complete.
